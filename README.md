CSCI201 Team#25 Final Project

Welcome to the Campfire!

Campfire is a web application where college students can input 
their schools, which will output a calendar that compares available
vaction times that overlap with their friends who attend different 
institutions than their own. This program can also check surrounding
locations for each school to find potential meeting spots that would
suffice for when a users friends visit their university, or vice versa. 

Users of this application are required to login to save their inputs
and make respective posts about their vacation locations.

This program was created utilizing maven, springboot, and tomcat, alongside general web dev methods through HTML/CSS, JS, and Java
